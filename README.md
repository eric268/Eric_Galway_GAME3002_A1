Code should be thoroughly commented but please let me know if you still need me to make a video

Goal
- Purpose of the game is to hit all 10 targets before the timer runs out
- The game starts when the start game button is pressed 
- The player then will need to hit the inital 5 targets in the goal.
- After the first 5 have been hit a target will appear in a random location inside the net
- The player has 6 seconds to hit the target before it moves to another location
- Hitting 10 targets before the time expires wins the game and potentially saves their time as a high score

Controls 
- W moves the targe  forward
- S moves the target backwards
- A moves the target left
- D moves the target right
- R moves the target up
- F moves the target down
- Q resets shooting positon. Must be done to be able to shoot again
